    "Before Exam Details": "You want to make your practical exam, but the instructor needs still to intervene sometimes and advises against the test? Then you should believe him. He don’t want to let you pay more lessons than you need. What he wants is that you get your license for a good value, so that you are happy and recommend the driving school. Exams are much more expensive than driving lessons, so he earns much more with a second exam than with a few lessons more. So please trust the expert and practice more.\n\nIf your instructor is satisfied with your driving skills, he advises you to do the exam. Tell him where you still feel uncertain and what you want to practice more. Make an appointment for the exam. Now you should decrease your weak spots, so that you feel safe. The most failed exams are not the product of bad knowledge or missing skills, but the product of nervousness. And the best way to manage nervousness is to feel safe.",

    "chapters": {
        "1": {
          "title": "First steps",
          "details": "Every beginning is difficult. At the start your driving instructor will explain you how you adjust and handle your workspace – the inner space of your car. In this chapter you learn the most important vocabulary, which help you to understand your instructor and to get know your vehicle. Start with the vocabulary, continue with the learning sentences and complete the lesson with testing yourself watching the video about the car."
        },
        "2": {
          "title": "We start driving",
          "details": "In this chapter you learn expressions you need for the first steps on the street. To handle the car is the topic today. You learn to understand your instructor, when he teaches you how to drive up, accelerate, break, and stop your car.\n\nThe most important sentence is “Füße weg” – which means “feet away.” That is the expression your instructor tells you when you are in a dangerous situation or when you block the street. When you move your feet away from pedals, he can defuse the situation.\n\nLike in the first chapter, start with vocabulary before you learn the sentences."
        },
        "3": {
          "title": "We use the street",
          "details": "If to start up and to shift the gears works already, you can enter the traffic. Your instructor will tell the direction. He also will explain you many things. At this point, it could be rational to work with an interpreter, so that you understand your mistakes. To translate the instructions is not the task of an interpreter. It is important that you understand all instructions, so that you can understand and react in time. \n\n For example: Your instructor wants to go right at the next crossing. He tells you in German language: “We want to go the next street right, you have to break first on about 20 km/h, then you take the second gear and leave the clutch before the crossing”. The interpreter needs to listen. He needs time for processing the information and for translation, too. It again takes time to tell you the information. And it takes time until you process the information. In the most cases you passed the crossing before you know what to do. In addition to that your instructor can´t support you during the process, cause the interpreter did not finish the translation. \n\n If you don´t understand your instructor, just go on and ask him. If you pass the crossing he wants to turn, you go another way, but nothing is happening. If you stop in the middle of a street for asking him, it can be very dangerous. Cars are also behind you and don´t expect you will stop without a sign. In the exam it is very important for you, to understand the examinator, so you can practice that in your lessons.\n\n Task of an interpreter is to translate the explanation of your instructor, so that you understand your mistakes. If he starts to translate directions or anything like that, please tell him to stop."

          "title": "We turn",
          "details": "To turn is one of the most important exercises for vehicle control. Interaction of speed, gear and time flow has to be accurate. If it is not, it can be, that you don´t come around the corner. \n\n Additionally, you need to take care on many other road user, cause pedestrians and bicycle drivers, who are crossing the street parallel to you, have priority. Opposing traffic has also priority, you need to take note of them and let them go first. Especially turning left, it is difficult to place your car right. 50 centimeters to much left or ahead means, that you place your car in the opposing traffic. \n\n It is very important to prepare early enough for turning, to consider all possibilities and take the right gear. That necessitates much practice. You need to understand the explanations of your instructor."

        "5":{
          "title":"Priority part 1",
          "details":"The topic priority is the widest chapter of this course and includes chapter 5 and 6. Hereby it is important to understand rules and signs. The main rule “priority to the right” is always valid if you don´t have a sign, traffic lights or police officers, which regulate the traffic. The right way to look is important for realize all crossings and their priority rules. \n\n Especially if you are used to the traffic of another country, it is hard to drive through a crossing without to protect yourself with breaking and looking. But this is necessary when you have priority. The risk of collision because of a break at a green light is much higher than a collision with someone who drive over red light. \n\n Exceptions are crossings with priority to right. But there you should just do a short look to left. If you see a car, which is not doing an evidently mistake, you should not stop. \n\n The sign “Give way” doesn´t force you to stop like the “stop sign” if no car with right of way is close. But sure the priority rules for pedestrians and bicycles are still valid."

          "title":"Follow the rules",
          "details":"If your instructor tells you: “you cannot drive, you just can handle the car” it sounds arrogant but is in the most cases the truth. What he means is, that there are many rules you don´t know or you just take not serious enough. At least in the exam you will see he is right. Many other road user don´t stop at the stop sign, pass a solid line or are too fast. \n\n But that´s not allowed for them as for you. A violation against applicable law does´n´t always mean an accident, but it always potentially dangerous. And if you make big or more violations it will let you fail your practical exam. \n\n As in at the chapter “priority” it is important that you note the right things and take the right looks. Not just at crossings. You should see all signs and marks, should follow the rules and react on mistakes of other road user. If you look what others do it is not always the right thing. So better look by yourself what you have to do."

          "title":"Motorway and countryside",
          "details":"To drive on a motorway is caused by the high speed dangerous and more risky. It is very important, that you understand the instructions of your driving instructor. The most difficult action is to enter the motorway. You have to accelerate much and you need to take care that nobody gets threaten or hampered. \n\n There is a suggested recommended speed of 130 km/h. If the weather is good and the street is free, you should approximate try to hold it. If possible you should overtake slower cars without losing speed. Overtaking has to be always on the left. After passing you have to go back on the right lane. There is a rule: “Drive on the right!” \n\n Before overtaking you have to clear up, that you have enough space for a lane change. On motorway you make a look to the site instead a look over your shoulder. \n\n When you exit the motorway take care not to break too early. You should not hamper the traffic behind you. \n\n When you arrive the required special lessons, you already made a good progress at your driving education. At the overland sessions you get know the rules for driving on country roads. \n\n An important consideration is to drive with the right speed. You are not allowed to exceed the speed limit, but you also should not go to slow. By the way there are road sections where the speed limit is too dangerous or not possible to drive. \n\n Overtaking is a topic, too. But you will see, that the track for overtaking is very long, so that a safe overtaking of trucks or other cars is not often possible."

There are six different kinds of basic tasks, which are split into two groups \n\n The first group includes the tasks “parallel parking” and “drive right backwards around the curve”. The examiner choose one of this tasks. \n\n The second group includes “to turn around”, “emergency break”, “parking backwards into a box” and “parking forward into a box” The examiner choose two of this tasks. \n\n It is important, that you are not just inside the parking area. You have also to do the right looks. The view back is indispensable. Who parks just with mirrors will not pass the test."

Operational safety and road safety are absolutely necessary. \n\n In the practical exam the examiner will ask you three questions to that topic. You need to know the basic and verifiable parts of your car and the associated rules. In this chapter you study all terms. In the video at the end you can test, if you understood all."
